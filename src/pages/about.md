Hi, I’m Baris Bayrak! Welcome to my blog, where I share my journey in tech, programming, and the projects I’m passionate about. I enjoy exploring new ideas, solving problems, and building tools that make life a little easier.

This site is my space to document what I’ve learned, experiment with ideas, and connect with others who share similar interests.

Feel free to connect or share your thoughts with me!
