# Remage: Simplifying Image Resizing and Watermarking (WIP)

Over the past few months, I’ve been building **Remage**, a project inspired by my need for a lightweight tool to handle essential image processing tasks. My goal was to create a straightforward app that avoids the complexity and bulk of larger image editors, focusing instead on a few core features that users need most often.

## Why I Built Remage

Like many creators, I often need a quick way to resize images or add watermarks. But the available options were either too complicated or lacked flexibility. I wanted something easy to access, tucked into the system tray, with just enough functionality to get the job done. So, I started working on Remage to fill that gap and offer a tool designed for simplicity and speed.

## Highlighted Features

Here are a few of the key features that make Remage stand out:

- **Quick Image Resizing**: Drag and drop an image, select a preset, and it’s resized instantly. This feature alone saves so much time compared to opening up a full editor.
  
- **Content Protection**: Protecting content is essential, so I included customizable watermarking to keep things secure. You can adjust the style, position, and opacity to fit your branding.

- **Cross-Platform Availability**: Remage runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so no matter which platform you’re on, the app is there to support your workflow.

## The Tech Behind Remage

To ensure high performance, I built the backend using **Rust**, known for its speed and efficiency, and integrated **Tauri** to make Remage a cross-platform desktop app. The frontend uses **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, providing a responsive, modern interface that’s easy to navigate.

## Challenges and Insights

One of the more interesting challenges was finding the right balance between functionality and simplicity. I wanted to include just enough features to cover core needs without overloading the interface. Optimizing image resizing performance also required some fine-tuning, especially to keep the app lightweight and resource-efficient.

## What’s Next for Remage?

This project is still evolving, and I’m constantly brainstorming ways to make it even better. Some planned features include:

- **Batch Processing**: This would allow users to resize and watermark multiple images at once, streamlining workflows even further.
- **Video Support**: Extending Remage to handle videos could make it a go-to tool for even more creators.

## Reflecting on the Journey

Creating Remage has been both a challenge and a joy. It’s a project that truly reflects my approach to app development: keeping things simple, effective, and accessible. I’m looking forward to seeing how users react and gathering feedback to keep improving the app.
